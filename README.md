# Developpment d'un module noyau linux par caract√®re
 
Welcome to the development repository of the Linux kernel model by character! 
This repository aims to provide a dedicated space for creating, developing, and exploring an innovative Linux kernel model focused on character-based management.

Objectives:

Dive into the fundamental intricacies of Linux kernel management, focusing intently on operations governed by character-based interactions.
Seamlessly compile, build, and experiment with the Linux kernel model using the comprehensive Makefile provided.
Construct an adaptable kernel model that adeptly mimics and dissects various scenarios rooted in character-based communication.
Nurture a space for learning and experimentation, catering to system aficionados and developers alike, who hold an avid interest in the realms of the Linux kernel.


Repository Contents:

A well-organized Makefile accompanies the source code of the Linux kernel model, streamlining the compilation and build processes.
Extensive documentation delves into the architectural nuances of the model, key character-based management concepts, and step-by-step directives to initiate your journey.
Contributor guidelines are at your disposal, detailing the art of contributing, reporting bugs, and partaking in the model's evolutionary journey..
