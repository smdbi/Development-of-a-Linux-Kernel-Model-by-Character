# Developpment d'un module noyau linux par caract√®re
 
Welcome to the development repository of the Linux kernel model by character! 
This repository aims to provide a dedicated space for creating, developing, and exploring an innovative Linux kernel model focused on character-based management.

Objectives:

Explore the fundamental mechanisms of Linux kernel management, focusing on character-based operations.
Develop an extensible kernel model that simulates and analyzes various character-based interaction scenarios.
Provide a learning and experimentation platform for system enthusiasts and developers interested in the Linux kernel.
Encourage community collaboration and contributions to enrich the model and explore new ideas.


Repository Contents:

Source code of the Linux kernel model by character, including implementation examples for different features.
Detailed documentation on the model's architecture, key character-based management concepts, and getting started instructions.(to be updated..)
Contributor guides explaining how to submit contributions, report issues, and participate in the model's development.(to be updated..)
Additional resources and references to deepen the understanding of Linux kernel management and its character-based interaction.(to be updated..)

Feel free to customize this description based on your specific goals for the repository. Good luck with your Linux kernel model development project :)
